the objective of the game is to slide color tiles on a grid to combine
them to create tiles with color of higher level. after every slide a new
tile of lowest color appears. the game ends if the highest color is
reached - VICTUS, or no free space for new tile - EXITUS.

scale for colors still to reach is on the left hand side, for colors
already reached on the right hand side. current scores are displayed in
upper left corner, high score in upper right corner.

key START or trigger starts new game and cancels current game. use cursor
keys or joystick to slide tiles.
